# Remote Logger CLI

Command line interface to follow incremental log files, filter lines and send to the remote-logger server.

NOTE: under development

# Basic usage

```
usage: Send your logs to remote endpoints [-h] -f FILTER [-c CONFIG]
                                          [-sh HOST] [-u USER] [-p PASSWD]
                                          [-e EXCHANGE] [-rk ROUTING_KEY]
                                          [-q QUEUE] [-sp PORT]
                                          [-et EXCHANGE_TYPE] [-hb HEARTBEAT]
                                          [-bct BLOCKED_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT]

```

# Example

```
$ # Using a configuration file:
$ remotelogger-cli.py --filter test/filter.yaml --config test/config.yaml 
$ # Using command line arguments:
$ remotelogger-cli.py --filter test/filter.yaml -sh localhost -u guest -p guest -e exchange -rk routing_key -q queue
```

# Config file

The Config file is an alternative way to provide connection configuration parameters instead of passing them as command line arguments.

## Config file example

Configuration file is in YAML format

```
{
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5672,
    "user": "guest",
    "pass": "guest",
    "exchange": "exchange",
    "exchange_type": "direct",
    "routing_key": "routing_key",
    "queue": "queue",
    "heartbeat": 0,
    "blocked_connection_timeout": 300
}
```

# Filter file

Filter file points to the log files to follow and defines filters to categorize log lines. 

Filters are based on regular expressions and uses https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html[re] library to match patterns.

Once a log line is filtered, some properties can be defined per filter:

- **severity**: Severity level of the message (_NONE, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, SUCCESS_)
- **verbosity**: Verbosity level (_None or 0-5_)

## Regular expressions

To filter a particular line of your log file you have to define the regular expression pattern.

Patterns https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax[sintax] are based on https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html[re] library

The filter feature is based on https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.match[re.match] function.

## Filter file example

Configuration file is in YAML format.

```
[
    {
        "filename": log.txt,
        "filters": [
            {pattern: "^INFO", severity: "INFO"}, 
            {pattern: "^WARN", severity: "WARNING"}
        ]
    },
    {
        "filename": log2.txt,
        "filters": [
            {pattern: "^ERROR", severity: "ERROR"}, 
            {pattern: "^OK", severity: "OK" }
        ]
    }
]
```
