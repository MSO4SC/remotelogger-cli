# Remote Logger CLI

Command line interface to follow incremental log files, filter lines and send to the remote-logger server.

NOTE: under development

# Basic usage

```
usage: Send your logs to remote endpoints [-h] -c CONFIG

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Path to config file
```

# Example

```
$ remotelogger-cli.py --config test/config.yaml
```

# Config file

Configuration file points to the log files to follow and defines filters to categorize log lines. 

Filters are based on regular expressions and uses (re)[https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html] library to match patterns.

Once a log line is filtered, some properties can be defined per filter:

- **severity**: Severity level of the message (_NONE, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, SUCCESS_)
- **verbosity**: Verbosity level (_None or 0-5_)
- **progress**: Percentage of progress (_0-100_)

## Regular expressions

To filter a particular line of your log file you have to define the regular expression pattern.

Patterns (sintax)[https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax] are based on (re)[https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html] library

The filter feature is based on (re.match)[https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.match] function.

## Config file example

Configuration file is in YAML format.

```
[
    {
        "filename": log.txt,
        "filters": [
            {pattern: "^INFO", verbosity: 1, severity: 1, progress: 1}, 
            {pattern: "^WARN", verbosity: 2, severity: 2, progress: 2}
        ]
    },
    {
        "filename": log2.txt,
        "filters": [
            {pattern: "^ERROR", verbosity: 3, severity: 3, progress: 3}, 
            {pattern: "^OK", verbosity: 4, severity: 4, progress: 4}
        ]
    }
]
```
